This is a bare bones solution accelerator for AI/BI Genie Spaces for Games.
Unlike our other solution accelerators there are no notebooks to run, outside of ingesting the WoW Kaggle Dataset if you'd like to use a games specific example dataset
All actions, otherwise, are done through the GUI here.
It will be easier to use your own datasets, however, as part of your exploration of this capability.
